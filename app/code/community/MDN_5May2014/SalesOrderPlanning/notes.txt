Planning must be updated when :
- Order is placed (manage adding handler on stocks_updated)
- Order is_valid changes
- Product reservation change 
- product stock change (not sure, not implemented for the moment)
- Product supply date change
- Order is shipped
- Order is canceled (should be managed)
- Product default supply delay change

Product availability status must be updated when :
- default supply delay change (update all products)
- #supplier supply delay changes (update all supplier's product)
- #product supply delay changes (update product)
- #product backinstock changes (update product)
- #product stock or ordered qty changes (update product)
- #product supply date changes (update product)
- #product stock status changes (update product)
- #product out of stock status changes (update product)
- #new product inserted (probably manages with previous conditions, no need to implement)

Todo :
- #Remove stock and availability templates / block (replace with original magento'one)
- #Implement is salable logic depending of product availability status data
- #Automatically update Product availability status depending of previous conditions
- #Use Product availability status in planning
- #Refresh planning when Product availability status changes
- #Rename productAvailabilityRange & productAvailabilityStatus to avoid confusions
- Each night, refresh product availability status for products with out of stock range
- #french translations
